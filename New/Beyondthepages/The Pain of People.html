            <p>Pain is an inevitable part of the human experience. Whether physical or emotional, we all experience pain
                at some point in our lives. Acknowledging the pain of others is essential for building empathy and
                understanding, as it helps us to connect with others on a deeper level. Pain is a prevalent issue that
                can affect people from all walks of life. It can manifest in different ways.</p>
            <p>From my very little experience of knowing the world, I have witnessed pain in lot of forms, not only in
                myself but in people I see in my day-to-day life. From physical to emotional pain, each person's
                experience is unique, and it's essential to acknowledge and empathize with their struggles.</p>

                <h3>A Mother</h3>
            </li>

            <p>Mothers often experience a deep sense of emotional pain when their children grow up and leave the nest.
                This
                pain can be particularly acute for mothers who have devoted much of their time and energy to raising
                their
                children. The sense of loss and separation can be overwhelming, leading to feelings of loneliness and
                emptiness.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the pain of losing a child can be unimaginable, as it shatters the very foundation of a
                mother's
                identity and purpose.</p>

            <p>I remember watching my mother experience this pain when I left for higher studies. I was just a little
                boy
                back
                then, she cried for days, and it took a while for her to adjust to the new reality. It was a difficult
                time
                for
                all of us, as we had to adapt to a new normal.</p>
            <p>One may relate, you see your world in your child, you raise them, you make them a gentle human being, you
                see
                them achieving little milestones, you see them dancing, crying, laughing, you take great pride and joy
                in
                their
                accomplishments and successes but, suddenly one day they leave you, and they never return back.
                Returning
                back
                doesn't always mean physically.</p>
            <p>From the labour pain in getting them to the pain of losing them, she takes all in her and never complains
                and
                despite the pain and the sadness, though, she always loves her child, no matter where life takes them.

                <h3>A Father</h3>
            </li>
            <p>As a child, we idolize our father. Someone who is always strong, always confident, and always there to
                protect
                us. A hard-working man who always put his family first. A hero in every sense of the word. He isn't just
                a
                protector, he's a provider too.</p>
            <p>He would always put on a brave face, a smile that seemed to hide any troubles he was going through.
                Fathers
                never let their struggles show, never complains, never asks for help. They just soldiers on, day after
                day,
                doing whatever it takes to make us happy.</p>
            <p>But as we grow older, the word Father perhaps become the most ignored in the world of relationships.
                Maybe it's
                not entirely their fault that they've become this way. It's more likely that society is to blame for
                putting
                pressure on them to be tough and authoritarian. In the process, they may have lost their sense of being
                a loving
                and caring father. We tend to assume that parenting is their responsibility, so we often take them for
                granted.
                That's our biggest mistake. We don't realize that they sacrifice their own happiness for ours and push
                us to
                succeed in life. So, we should be more grateful for their efforts and sacrifices.</p>

                <h3>A Girl</h3>
            </li>

            <p>A Girl encounter a multitude of challenges that inflict pain and instill fear, often in deeply personal
                ways.
                From the physical discomfort and emotional strain of menstruation to the pervasive threat of violence,
                these
                experiences shape her daily lives and impact her well-being.</p>
            <p>Many girls also face stereotypes or biases that affect their ability to succeed or be taken seriously.
                For
                instance, they may be seen as emotional, weak, or less competent than their male counterparts, leading
                to them
                being given less responsibility or fewer opportunities to showcase their abilities.</p>
            <p>The societal expectations to look beautiful also has a significant impact on their self-esteem and mental
                health. Credits to the beauty industry for promoting the unrealistic beauty standards.</p>
            <p>The pain and discomfort associated with menstruation is an entirely different story. For many girls,
                menstruation is nightmare. Especially for those who experience a disturbed period. As a boy I can never
                relate
                how it can affect their ability to work, go to school/college and engage in daily activities.</p>
            <p>But the physical pain is only half the story. Many girls and women also experience significant social
            pressure
            and stigma surrounding menstruation. Society has long considered periods as dirty, shameful, and something
            that
            should be kept hidden from view. As a result, girls feel embarrassed or ashamed to discuss their periods
            with
            friends or family.</p>
            <p>She can't go wherever she wants, she would need a trustworthy male along with her. She is always limited
                with
                her unlimited potential.</p>

        </div>



        <div>
            <li class="liMain">
                <h3>A Boy</h3>
            </li>
            <p>Imagine being a young boy, just trying to make sense of the world around you. You fall down and scrape
                your
                knee, tears streaming down your face. But before you can even think about crying, you hear the words,
                "Don't
                cry, you are a boy." You swallow your tears and try to act tough, but inside you feel lost and alone.
            </p>
            <p>As you grow up, you hear those same phrases over and over again. "Be strong, you are a boy.", "Take
                responsibility, you are a boy." And you start to believe that being a boy means burying your emotions
                deep
                inside, never letting anyone see the pain or fear that you carry with you.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, those emotions are always there, simmering just below the surface. You feel them when
                you
                watch your loved ones suffer, or when you fail a test, or you are rejected by your crush. And you try to
                hide
                them, because that's what you've been told to do.</p>
            <p>It's exhausting, always trying to be the tough guy, always pretending that everything is okay when it's
                not. You
                feel like you're carrying a weight on your shoulders, a burden that you can never quite shake off. And
                you
                wonder if anyone else feels the same way.</p>

        <div>
            <li class="liMain">
                <h3>A Friend</h3>
            </li>

            <p>We often build deep connections with our friends, sharing our joys and sorrows, and building memories
                that last
                a lifetime. But as time goes by, things can change. Friends can grow apart, move away, or simply become
                too busy
                to maintain the relationship. And when that happens, we can feel a sense of loss and loneliness that is
                hard to
                shake off.</p>
            <p>It's hard to see people who were once a significant part of our lives slowly drift away. We may try to
                stay in
                touch, but life has a way of getting in the way. As we get older, we become busier, and our priorities
                change.
                Sometimes, we just grow apart, and it's nobody's fault. It's a very strange feeling to miss someone who
                is still
                alive, but who is no longer a part of your life. You may find yourself thinking about the good times you
                shared,
                the inside jokes.</p>
            <p>Perhaps what hurts the most is the feeling of isolation that comes with losing a friend. You may have
                other
                friends, but they can never quite fill the void left by the friend who has gone. You may feel like no
                one really
                understands you the way your old friend did, or that you can't be your true self around the people you
                know now.
                You may feel like you're carrying a burden that no one else can help you with.</p>
            <p>The friendship always remains valuable, but without the friend.</p>

            <p>As someone who grew up away to my grandparents, I know how special and meaningful those relationships can
                be.
                They experience emotional pain when they are unable to see or spend time with their grandchildren.
                <br>It's
                heart-breaking to see a grandparent miss out on important moments in their grandchildren's lives, such
                as
                birthdays, and other milestones due to distance, estrangement, or family conflict.
            </p>
            <p>As a child, I would visit my grandparents' house and my dada ji would always ask me to sit with him and
                talk to
                him, I would often ignore him and run around with my cousins instead. I was too young to understand his
                emotions. Now I feel his grief and it is the price we pay for love, but love remains even when they are
                no more
                with you.</p>

            <p>While reading and sympathizing with others, you realise that you are also in the same boat.<br> Grief,
                Rejection,
                Betrayal, Shame, Loneliness, Fear, Regrets, all these are surrounding you like the huge ocean surrounds
                the
                ship. You fake you smile, You break the promises you made to yourself, You fear of what people will
                think of
                you, but at the same time you pretend that you don't care. You try to make yourself believe that you
                don't care,
                but this very instinct of yours is enough to prove that you do care.</p>
            <p>You want to be happy, but you're bound to the challenges. Sometimes you feel really good that you have
                managed
                to get a place here despite of the hurdles you'd faced in your past. But that happiness is never long
                lasting,
                it disappears just like the sun disappears when clouds cover it.<br> You pretend to be normal, but
                inside you
                there
                lie a volcano of emotional conflicts. May you know when it starts erupting.</p>

        <p>I am not a motivational coach, nor I have any
            expertise in helping people deal with their problems, so I don't know how we can eliminate those pains,
            but with
            this positive approach of discussion, we can create deeper, more meaningful connections with the people
            we care
            about, and help them navigate the challenges of life with greater confidence and resilience. I mean <a
                class="line">even if the
                clouds cover the Sun, the day is still bright</a>.
            And a good part to know is that the Sun is always there, it had never gone anywhere.</p>

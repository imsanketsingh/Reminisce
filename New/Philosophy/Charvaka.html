                <h3>Preparing the base</h3>
            </li>
            <div style="padding: 1px 10px 1px 8px; line-height: 1.4;">
                <p>During the Vedic period, lots of people were engaged in Vedic rituals (also known as <i>Vedic
                        Karmakanda</i>). At the same time the Upanishads were also being compiled and lots of people
                    were going with that too.<br>
                    While this all was happening, those who did not get the satisfactory explanation from either of the
                    ways, chose to find a new way to explain the very nature of this world and other metaphysical
                    aspects of it.<br>
                    Those who followed this trend of seeking for something beyond Vedas were known as <i>Sharavana</i>
                    (also known as <i>Nastikas</i> as they did not believe in the supremacy of Vedas). At some point of
                    time, there were a total of 63 Sharavana schools of thought in India, out of which 3 were the most
                    popular ones - The Buddhism, The Jainism and The Charvakas.</p>
            </div>
        </div>



        <div>
            <li class="liMain">
                <h3>Who were the Charvakas?</h3>
            </li>
            <div style="padding: 1px 10px 1px 8px; line-height: 1.4;">
                <p> The followers of one of the <i>Nastik darshan</i> (atheistic philosophy), Charvaka. Both the
                    philosophy and the followers are known as Charvaka.</p>
                <p> Charvaka philosophy is also known as <b>Lokayat</b> philosophy as a result of their belief in
                    <i>Ehiloka</i> meaning "This world only". <br>
                    It's the only Indian philosophy that believes in the fact that there is just one world and that is
                    currently where we are living. There is no world beyond this one. No <i>Ishwara</i> (God), No
                    <i>Atma</i> (Soul), No <i>Swarga</i> (Heaven), No <i>Naraka</i> (Hell), No <i>Moksha</i>
                    (Liberation).
                </p>

                <h4>Why the name Charvaka?</h4>

                <div style="padding: 1px 10px 10px 0px;">
                    <p>There are 3 perceptions of their name being Charvaka.</p>
                    <ol style="line-height: 1.4;">
                        <li>Many historians believe that it's made up of two words - <i>Charu</i> (beautiful) +
                            <i>Wakk</i> (words).
                            So, they were the people of spoke beautiful words.
                            It's believed that they used to speak very interesting things and people were curious to
                            listen to them.
                        </li><br>

                        <li>Some historians also believe that the name is made up of a Sanskrit root word, <i>Charv</i>,
                            which means to chew. Those who oppose their philosophy, allege that they used to chew the
                            ethics/morality of the society.</li><br>

                        <li>The 3rd perception is very interesting. It's widely believed that Charvaka was initially a
                            man before it came to exist as a thought or philosophy. It's a general acceptance among the
                            historians that the Charvaka philosophy was introduced by <b>Rishi Vryahsapati</b>, who is
                            also regarded as the guru of all devatas. That's why Charvaka philosophy is also called
                            <b>Vryahsapatya philosophy</b>.
                        </li>

                        <p> One question may arise, that why would the saint Vryahsapati believe in a philosophy which
                            is so against the Vedic literatures?<br>
                            I mean the devatas used to believe in the Vedic philosophy so, why in any world their own
                            guru would tend to differ from their belief.</p>

                        <p>The reason intellectuals quote is that this literature was made to distract the <i>Asuras</i>
                            and to keep them busy in their worldly possessions. So that they can never get par with the
                            devatas.</p>

                </div>

        <div>
            <li class="liMain">
                <h3>Benefit of doubt</h3>
            </li>
            <div style="padding: 1px 10px 1px 8px; line-height: 1.4;">
                <p> Although the Charvaka is the most criticized philosophy in against the Vedic philosophy, but it
                    deserves a benefit of doubt in certain manners.
                    Currently, there exists no authentic source that can represent the actual beliefs of Charvaka
                    philosophy.</p>
                <h4>Why is so?</h4>
                <p> It's believed that the Charvakas were very aggressive & outspoken people. They used to speak loudly
                    & openly against the Vedas, the Vedic rituals, the purohits (Vedic priests).<br>
                    Hence, the people who were following the Vedic philosophy used to be very angry with the Charvakas.
                    Perhaps in this tussle, the original literatures of Charvakas had been destroyed.</p>

                <h4>So how do we know about them?</h4>
                First of all, it's actually very comical and sarcastic.<br>
                No one is certain about the knowledge we have about the Charvakas. What the Charvakas believed, we don't
                know.
                But what the other philosophers or Schools of thought wrote to criticize Charvakas is available and from
                that we get to know about what the Charvakas used to believe.<br>
                It's like reading China's doctrine to understand Taiwanese values.
                Anyway, we get to see the Charvakas being criticized in the literatures of every major Indian school of
                thought. Hence, it becomes very important to give Charvakas a benefit of doubt, because we don't know
                whether what's written about them is actually true or NOT.

                <h3>Major References</h3>
            </li>
            <div style="padding: 1px 10px 1px 8px; line-height: 1.4;">
                <p> The first literature that talks about Charvakas dates back to 9th century AD (After approximately
                    1500 years).
                    A book called <i>"Tatva Viplav Sangh"</i> by Jai Rashi Bhatt has a little description about who the
                    Charvakas actually were.<br>

                    The next mentioning of the Charvakas can be found straight 200 years after that. A small play in
                    Sanskrit called <i>"Prabodh Chandrodaya"</i> by Krishna Mishra in 11th century AD. It's the one and
                    only literature written in the favor of Charvakas.<br>

                    The major literature that accounts for almost 90% of the information we have today about the
                    Charvakas come from a book called <i>"Sarva Darshan Sangraha"</i> in 14th century AD by
                    <b>Madhavacharya Vidyaranya</b>, the head of the <i>Sringeri Sharada Peetham</i>, a prominent center
                    of learning in South India.
                    That book was a collection of all the major philosophies in India.<br>

                    All the Charvaka sutras mainly come from that one single book of Madhavacharya only. But the thing
                    to note is that the book was a critic of Charvaka philosophy.

            </li>
            <div style="padding: 1px 10px 1px 8px; line-height: 1.4;">
                <p> The core of a philosophical system generally consists of three components:
                <ol type="a" style="line-height: 2;">
                    <li class="liShort">Epistemology: Deals with how we acquire knowledge, what constitutes knowledge,
                        and the limitations of knowledge.</li>

                    <li class="liShort">Metaphysics: Deals with the nature of reality, including questions about the
                        existence of gods, the afterlife, and the ultimate nature of the universe.</li>

                    <li class="liShort">Ethics: Deals with questions about moral values, principles, and behavior.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Let's discuss it one by one.</p>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li class="liSubMain">Epistemology:</li>

                    <p>Epistemology lit. theory of knowledge or <i>gyan-mimansa</i>. It tells us about the nature,
                        origin & scope of knowledge within the realm of that philosophy.
                        Talking about Charvakas, they believed on one single sutra -</p>

                    <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Pratiyakshameva ekam pramanam</i></div>
                    <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 70%;">What's perceived is the only evidence.</div>

                    <h4>What does this mean?</h4>

                    <p>Believe what you see, don't accept anything that you can't see or feel and sensory experience is
                        the only means of gaining knowledge.</p>
                    <p>According to Vedanta or Vedic philosophy, there are 6 forms of evidence.</p>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li><i>Pratyaksha</i></li>
                        <li><i>Anumana</i></li>
                        <li><i>Upamana</i></li>
                        <li><i>Shabda</i></li>
                        <li><i>Arthapatti</i></li>
                        <li><i>Anupalabdhi</i></li>
                    </ol> <br>
                    <a href="https://www.hindu-blog.com/2019/09/six-types-of-evidence-accepted-in.html"
                        target="_blank">Read more about these forms of evidence here.</a><br>
                    The Charvakas were the only one who believed in just one form of evidence i.e. perception
                    (<i>Pratyaksha</i>).<br><br>


                    <li class="liSubMain">Metaphysics:</li>
                    <p>The metaphysics or <i>tatva-mimansa</i> of Charvakas revolve around the concept of materialism.
                        The main question that metaphysics deals with is to now if the ultimate reality is physical
                        (material) or it is conscious.<br>
                        Now, consciousness is not visible through eyes, hence for Charvakas the ultimate reality lies in
                        the material nature of this world.</p>

                    <h4>What constitutes this material world (acc. to Charvakas)?</h4>
                    <p>Vedic philosophy believes in 5 elements including Space (Akasha). But since the space can't be
                        perceived hence Charvakas would not count it.</p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Prithivya-apa-tejoh-vayur-iti tatvani</i></div>
                    <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 70%;">Earth (Prithvi or Prithivya), Water (Apa), Fire
                        (Tejoh or Tez), Air (Vayu) are the only elements (Tatvas).</div>


                    <p>Everything that is physical is made up of different combinations of the 4 elements.</p>

                    <h4>Now a simple question arises that who makes up these different combinations?</h4>
                    <p>Since Charvakas did not believe in the existence of God (<i>Ishwara</i>), hence the explanation
                        given by them was <i>"The very nature of these elements is such that they mix up on their own in
                            different proportions to constitute to different materials"</i>.<br>
                        The Charvakas believed in mechanical theory i.e. the universe was not created by any god but it
                        was a product of material elements, and consciousness was simply a by-product of the physical
                        brain.</p>

                    <h4>Concept of soul</h4>
                    <p>7 out of the 9 major philosophies in India believes in the concept of soul except Buddhism and
                        the Charvaka philosophy.
                        According to Buddhism, soul is nothing but the flow of consciousness.
                        For Charvakas, the following lines catter their belief about soul -</p>
                    <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Chaitanya-vishistho deh eva aatma,<br>kshinam
                            sukhadukhanvitam</i></div>
                    <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 70%;">Consciousness (<i>chaitanya</i>) is present within
                        the body as the soul (atma), which is subject to pleasure and pain.</div>


                    <li class="liSubMain">Ethics:</li>
                    <p>In my views, ethics is the most important component of a philosophy, because it deals with
                        questions about moral values, principles, and behavior, which are central to how individuals and
                        societies make decisions and live their lives.<br>
                        In the case of Charvaka philosophy, their ethics emphasized the importance of pleasure and
                        enjoyment in life, with little concern for morality beyond the immediate satisfaction of
                        desires.</p>

                    <h4>Views on Purusharthas</h4>
                    <p>In Vedic philosophy, the four types of Purusharthas are <i>Dharma</i>, <i>Artha</i>, <i>Kama</i>,
                        and <i>Moksha</i>. These four aims or goals are considered the primary objectives of human life.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <p>
                            <li class="dakm"><i>Dharma</i></li>This refers to righteous conduct or duty. It is the moral
                            and ethical foundation of life, encompassing social and personal responsibilities, duties,
                            and obligations. It includes following the codes of conduct prescribed by one's social
                            status, family, and community.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li class="dakm"><i>Artha</i></li>This refers to material wealth, power, and success. It
                            includes the pursuit of financial prosperity, social status, and political power. However,
                            it is also expected that these pursuits should be conducted with ethical means and in
                            accordance with dharma.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li class="dakm"><i>Kama</i></li>This refers to sensual pleasure or desire. It includes
                            fulfilling one's desires, such as romantic love, physical pleasure, and enjoyment of arts,
                            music, and beauty. However, like artha, it is also expected that these desires should be
                            fulfilled within the framework of dharma.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <li class="dakm"><i>Moksha</i></li>This refers to liberation or freedom from the cycle of
                            birth and death, and the attainment of spiritual enlightenment. It is the ultimate goal of
                            human life and involves transcending the limitations of the ego and realizing the true
                            nature of the self.
                        </p>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These four Purusharthas are interrelated and interdependent, and it is believed that the pursuit
                        of each is necessary for a fulfilling life. However, the ultimate aim is the attainment of
                        Moksha or spiritual liberation.<br>
                        The Charvakas believed that the pursuit of material wealth (Artha) and sensual pleasure (Kama)
                        were the only goals worth pursuing in life. They rejected the notion of Dharma and Moksha as
                        mere fantasies or illusions.</p>

                    <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Kama eva ekah purushartha</i></div>
                    <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 70%;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama"
                            target="_blank"><i>Kama</i></a> is the only purushartha.</div>

                    <h4>About Life after Death</h4>
                    <p>According to the Charvaka philosophy, life is short and unpredictable, and there is no life after
                        death. Therefore, one should enjoy life to the fullest and pursue material pleasures and success
                        while ignoring any consideration of religious, moral, or ethical duties. They believed that
                        there is no higher purpose to human life other than the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of
                        pain.</p>


                    <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Peetva peetva punah peetva,<br>Yavaj jivet sukham
                            jivet,<br>rinam kritva ghritam pibet,<br>Bhasmibhutasya dehasya kutah punaragamanam.</i>
                    </div>
                    <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 70%;">Drink and drink again and again, as long as you
                        live happily. As long as you live, live happily and drink ghee even if you need to borrow money
                        for that. For who knows if this body will turn to ashes and come back again?</div>


                    <p>This verse emphasizes the Charvaka's philosophy of hedonism, which stresses the importance of
                        pursuing pleasure and enjoyment in life. The verse suggests that one should enjoy life as much
                        as possible and indulge in pleasures such as drinking, as life is unpredictable and fleeting.
                    </p>


                    <h4>About Heaven and Hell</h4>

                    <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Sukhamev swargam, dukhamev narakam</i></div>
                    <div style="text-align: center; font-size: 70%;">Happiness is heaven, and sorrow is hell.</div>

                    <p>The idea that <i>Sukhamev swargam, dukhamev narakam</i> continues to be relevant even in our
                        modern society, as individuals continue to seek happiness and fulfilment in their lives, and the
                        pursuit of happiness is seen as a fundamental human right.</p>

                    <h4>About Dharma</h4>
                    <p>The Charvaka school of thought saw religion as a form of a mental disease or a delusion that
                        prevented individuals from living their lives to the fullest.
                        From the perspective of the Charvakas, religion was seen as a human invention that was used to
                        exploit and control people.<br>They believed that priests and religious leaders used the <b>fear
                            of punishment</b> in the afterlife or the promise of reward to manipulate people into
                        following their teachings and obeying their commands.</p>

                    <h4>About the quality of pleasure</h4>
                    <p>Charvakas believed that all pleasures are of equal value and that pleasure should be the ultimate
                        aim of human life. They did not believe in any distinction between higher or lower pleasures,
                        nor did they consider any pleasure to be inherently bad or sinful. They asserted that pleasure
                        is the ultimate good and pain the ultimate evil, and that one should seek pleasure and avoid
                        pain in all aspects of life.</p>
                    <p>A real-life example that supports Charvaka belief that pleasure is the ultimate good could be
                        someone who chooses to pursue a career in a field that brings them immense joy and satisfaction,
                        even if it may not pay as well as other careers that they are not passionate about. For
                        instance, a person who enjoys painting may choose to pursue a career as an artist, even if it
                        means making less money than they would in a different profession. This person is prioritizing
                        their pleasure and satisfaction over material wealth or status, which aligns with Charvaka
                        philosophy.<br><br>
                        One possible real-life negative example related to Charvakas belief that all pleasures are of
                        equal value is the behaviour of someone who indulges in excessive or unhealthy habits in pursuit
                        of pleasure. For instance, a person who spends all their money and time partying, drinking
                        excessively or using drugs may enjoy the immediate pleasure, but these activities can have
                        negative consequences on their health, relationships, and financial stability.</p>

                <h3>The Conclusion</h3>
            </li>
            <div style="padding: 1px 10px 1px 8px; line-height: 1.4;">
                <p>While the rejection of traditional religious beliefs may be seen as controversial or even offensive
                    by some, it is important to understand that their beliefs were rooted in a specific philosophical
                    and cultural context.<br> The Charvaka philosophy emerged during a period of intense social and
                    religious change in ancient India, and their ideas can be seen as a response to the dominant
                    philosophical and religious traditions of the time.<br>
                    While Charvakas are still assumed as the people who lacked spiritual or transcendent dimension, who
                    had a very limited perspective of the world, who emphasized on materialism, who rejected the moral
                    and ethical codes but despite these facts Indian philosophy will always be grateful to the
                    Charvakas. There are several reasons for that.<br>
                    First, the Charvaka philosophy challenged traditional religious and philosophical beliefs and
                    encouraged <b>critical thinking and skepticism</b>, which helped to stimulate intellectual curiosity
                    and openness in Indian thought.<br>
                    Second, the Charvaka philosophy emphasized personal experience and empirical evidence, which helped
                    to promote a scientific and rational approach to understanding the world.<br>
                    Third, the Charvaka philosophy promoted <b>individual freedom and autonomy</b>, which helped to
                    foster a sense of personal agency and responsibility.
                    Finally, the Charvaka philosophy played an important role in shaping the development of Indian
                    philosophy by contributing to debates and discussions about the nature of reality, consciousness,
                    and ethics, which helped to enrich and diversify Indian philosophical thought.<br>
                    It is true that all of what we know about Charvaka philosophy is based on the writings of other
                    philosophers and scholars who were critical of their ideas. This means that our understanding of
                    Charvaka philosophy is <b>unarguably biased and incomplete</b>. Without access to original Charvaka
                    texts and sources, it is difficult to know with certainty what their beliefs and ideas were.</p>
